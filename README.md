A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to host the [hack.siv.org](https://hack.siv.org) landing page.

## Getting Started

First time, install local dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
